## About the Game

This Whack-a-Monster game was created using object orient programming, Processing. The purpose of this game is for users to hit the monsters moving on the screen with their mouse. As monsters are hit, they will disappear through animations and the player's score will increase, displayed in the top left-hand corner. Use the mouse to destroy the monsters by clicking and aiming with base of the sword.
